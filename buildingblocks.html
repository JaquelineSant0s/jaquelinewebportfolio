            <h1>Mentoring Platform for UBC Neuroscience Department</h1>
            <p>Building Blocks is a peer mentorship app. Using our algorithm, first-year students are connected upper-year students based on their program of study, background, and interests. Mentees will be able to go to their mentors for questions and support. Peer mentors will receive training and guidance for their role and reach out to their mentees throughout the school year. The hope is that mentors and mentees can talk about their shared experiences as students. The app's chat function will allow for both private messaging and group discussions so students can stay connected and foster a sense of community.</p>
            <p>The application is built by a group of UBC students and I was invited to contribute to this ongoing project as UI designer working producing wireframes and mockups on Figma software.</p>
            <p>Since I started in July, I could produce many mockups related to the landing page, especially the blog posts area and I'm also currently working on finalizing the dashboards for three different users (mentors, mentees and administrators of UBC alumni clubs).</p>
            <p>With UBC Neuroscience Department partnership and investment, we will release the beta version in the next September.</p>
