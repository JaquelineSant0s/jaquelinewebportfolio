            <h1>Pivot Care<br>
                Mobile App & Web Platform
            </h1>

            <p>Pivot Care is a mobile application that helps companies to continue providing fitness and mental health care for their employees while they working from home, as a way to prevent occupational related injuries such as Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) and Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WRMD).</p>
            <p>Based on the needs of each group of employees or individuals, companies can setup customized exercises programs with the supervision and monitoring of specialized instructors. The main purpose of the application is to provide focused activities related to the specific work environment of the company, such as yoga, meditation, and company-wide stretch breaks.</p>
            <p>Here you can see some images of this MVP project developed by a team, that are part of the documentation delivered in Capstone Project, the last term of the post-degree diploma in Web & Mobile Design and Development at Langara College.</p>
            
            <div class="responsibilities">

            </div>

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>Emphasize and understand the problem, which was not difficult considering more than half of the team already had experience with companies that offer ways of physical activity and are concerned about sedentary lifestyles and everyone in the team has been suffering from the lack of mobility caused by remote work and difficulty in planning outdoor activities.</p>
            <p>Define the problem, minimum scope, unique value preposition, fair advantages and success criteria thought a Lean Canvas.</p> 
            <p>Ideate brainstorming and sketching a key message and list of possible solutions designing personas and journeys analyzing pain points and also checking competitors and similar digital products and solutions.The main challenge was make the concept appealing to people who are not physically active and/or who do not have fitness as a priority. For example, in designing the brand, we opted for calmer colors and softer color palettes compared to exercise applications available on the market.</p>
            <p>Designing userflow, low fidelity wireframes and interactions while development team build rough IA structure and flow. In this phase, the most difficult part was gathering and transforming the task list of the company's representative user into an intuitive flow, since the journey of offering and suggesting physical activities to the company's employees did not seem very intuitive initially.</p>
            <p>Review and reorganize schedule adjusting according to remain time and sources focusing in a safe defined deadline.This was where the team stood out the most, as the team of developers and designers had very open communication as a priority and very honest discussions about what could be fully implemented by the deadline, designers were able to adjust, follow closely and participate of implementation. In the relationship of UI versus Front-end, this communication is one of the great differentials for completing a consistent UI.</p>
            <p>Implementation, checkup of SEO requirements, design requirements, testing in many devices as possible building a bug list.Again, the interest of everyone involved in the process to deliver the best result resulted in an intense period of testing the platform in all available formats, sizes and browsers resulting in a consistent delivery.</p>
            <p>Finalization and conclusion of all documentation related to the project including marketing and business material, business pitch and demos.</p>
