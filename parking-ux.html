                Parking Lot System

            <p>
                This is the ux design project for the computerized parking lot system in Brazil. For this reason, some of the labels are still in portuguese.
                The system initially allows the registration of vehicles entering and leaving and calculating the parking value 
                based on the variables pre-configured in the system, such as vehicle type, time of day and day of the week. 
                The client decided to create a computerized system using react Native programming language and has 
                the intention of make a second version of the software from computerized manual system allowing 
                automating the parking lot with adding automated gates.
                I was hired to design the user experience from drafts of the system under construction and screenshots of competitors.

                    One of the biggest challenges of the content management in this first phase was 
                    to translate the system logic to a screen that accommodates zones and 
                    categories in the same table of values, making the table easy to edit and delete values.
                 </p>
                <p>
                   The user experience project containing the list of client requirements 
                   was built in 4 weeks and two reviews were made before final delivery of this first phase.
                   This project is ongoing in second phase, when we are setting up configuration 
                   and levels of system access according to user profiles, cash flow and reports.
