                Savy Web Platform<br>
                UX Concept
            </h1>

            <p>
                As you know from <a href="savy-project.html">Savy Project Page</a>, Savy is a responsive web platform that provides a variety of information 
                about recycling and improve users recycling habits by teaching and inspiring 
                them to do the right thing. This website would empower the activities of 
                environmental groups and governments by giving them statistics on 
                each province in Canada.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are some parts of UX content developed by me, regarding the Waste Management features, 
                that consists in a searching page with two outputs, one of them is the list of places that 
                manage waste with details and a section with recycling facts about the types of waste.
                Further in the project there was a possibility of users geolocation and we could 
                implement also best route according to user location and the UX and UI were updated 
                to attend these new possibilities.
            </p>

            <div class="responsibilities">
                <h2>Business Goals</h2>
